Hi everyone! Welcome to the data blog of the Triangle Research Libraries Network, TRLN. This blog is intended to be a place where professionals who work with data in TRLN institutions and beyond can share about their data-related projects.

### Contributing a Post
If you have a data-related project and would like to contribute a post, we would **love** to hear from you! We are especially interested in posts that share information about technical issues, how projects were carried out, and can provide instructions for others.

## Guidelines for Submission
All blog posts need to be text files written either in plain text or markdown. You can save your file as a .txt or .md format and email it to [ablaine@ncsu.edu](mailto:ablaine@ncsu.edu).

Please contact [Alison](mailto:ablaine@ncsu.edu) with questions!
